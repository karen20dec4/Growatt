description: Build, install, launch, inspect, and screenshot the Solar Monitor Android app in the local headless Android emulator. Use when the user asks to verify Android UI changes, test the Retro or Simple dashboard, check theme persistence, capture emulator screenshots, inspect app crashes/logcat, confirm the APK version, or diagnose the local Android emulator/AVD setup on the HP Linux server.

# Solar Monitor Emulator

Use the tracked helper for deterministic emulator checks:

```bash
cd /opt/solar-monitor
.codex/skills/solar-monitor-emulator/scripts/emulator-check.sh verify
```

This verifies KVM and the AVD, starts Android headlessly if needed, waits for boot, builds and installs the
debug APK, launches the app, captures a screenshot/UI hierarchy/logcat, and fails on a detected app crash.
Artifacts go to the gitignored `android/build/emulator-artifacts/` directory.

## Environment

- SDK: `/opt/android-sdk`
- Emulator: `/opt/android-sdk/emulator/emulator`
- AVD: `SolarMonitor_API_34`
- Device profile: Pixel 6, 1080×2400
- Image: `system-images;android-34;google_apis;x86_64`
- Package/activity: `com.rolling7.solar/.MainActivity`
- Acceleration: `/dev/kvm`
- Headless renderer: `swangle` (stable with Emulator 36.6.11 on this host)
- Process lifetime: transient `solar-monitor-emulator.service` created by `systemd-run`; keep it alive only
  during active development or verification

Use `ANDROID_SDK_ROOT` or `ANDROID_HOME` to override the SDK and `SOLAR_AVD_NAME` to override the AVD.
Use `SOLAR_EMULATOR_GPU` only for diagnosis; the verified default is `swangle`. Do not switch back to
`swiftshader_indirect`: on this host it has repeatedly terminated Emulator 36.6.11 with `SIGSEGV`.

## Commands

```bash
SCRIPT=.codex/skills/solar-monitor-emulator/scripts/emulator-check.sh
$SCRIPT doctor
$SCRIPT start
$SCRIPT wait
$SCRIPT build
$SCRIPT install
$SCRIPT launch
$SCRIPT screenshot
$SCRIPT retro-tabs
$SCRIPT status
$SCRIPT stop
```

Pass a PNG path as the second argument to `screenshot` or `verify` when a stable destination is needed.

## Verification workflow

1. Run `verify` and retain its screenshot, UI XML, and logcat paths.
2. Inspect the PNG with the local image-viewing tool; compilation alone is not visual proof.
3. Check `status` for Android version, resolution, installed app version, process PID, and saved theme.
4. For theme-switch testing, open Settings in the emulator, switch `Retro / Simple`, relaunch the app, and
   confirm `shared_prefs/solar_dashboard_style.xml` through `adb shell run-as com.rolling7.solar`.
5. Inspect logcat for `AndroidRuntime`, `FATAL EXCEPTION`, layout symptoms, or networking failures when the
   screenshot does not show live data.
6. Leave the emulator running only while actively iterating. At the end of every emulator/release task,
   always run `stop` and verify that `solar-monitor-emulator.service` is inactive, no `qemu-system-x86`
   process remains, and ADB lists no emulator. Keep it running after the task only when the user explicitly
   asks. Never leave the AVD idle between sessions: on this host it can consume multiple CPU cores and
   roughly 5 GB RAM.

For the fixed Retro layout, run `retro-tabs` after any Compose or Photoshop-asset change. It taps all four
navigation regions on the pinned Pixel 6 AVD, saves `retro-tab-{tablou,energie,sistem,setari}.png`, confirms
the selected-tab semantics, and fails if Android exposes a scrollable container on any Retro page.

The emulator uses the app's existing read-only HTTPS API. Do not add inverter writes or direct serial access.

## Repair/setup

Only when `doctor` reports missing components, install the pinned packages and recreate the AVD:

```bash
yes | /opt/android-sdk/cmdline-tools/latest/bin/sdkmanager --sdk_root=/opt/android-sdk \
  "emulator" "system-images;android-34;google_apis;x86_64"

echo no | /opt/android-sdk/cmdline-tools/latest/bin/avdmanager create avd \
  --name SolarMonitor_API_34 \
  --package "system-images;android-34;google_apis;x86_64" \
  --device pixel_6 \
  --force
```

Do not recreate a healthy AVD. Report whether the check was compile-only or included a rendered screenshot.
